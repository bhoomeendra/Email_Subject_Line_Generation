Hey Team.
I need the following services set up on National Fuel.
IAS we just created k A02353 ISS I think we already have this set up on kH02262 FSS Nat Fuel has not assigned this contract to us yet.
Believe me, this all happened really fast.
I just sent some of the paperwork  to legal and I need it back by Monday morning. @subject

Hey Team.
I need the following services set up on National Fuel.
IAS we just created k A02353 ISS I think we already have this set up on kH02262 FSS Nat Fuel has not assigned this contract to us yet.
Believe me this all happened really fast.
I just sent some of the paperwork to legal and I need it back by Monday morning.
